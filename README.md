# KidStuff
Apps for the grandkids, built primarily for use on a Raspberry Pi

## My latest attempt: piapp
You'll find several subdirectories in this repository.  These reflect a progression of "edutainment" apps I've been writing for the grandkids as I've observed their evolving interests and abilities.  First came "musicpad", a klunky musicplayer the kids could control using a USB keypad.  Next cane "pygames", a spelling app integrated with Amazon's TTS engine Polly.  It was at this point I decided to add a 7" LCD touchscreen to the Pi, since the kids had already figured out how to use that technology from playing with their parent's smartphones (and they were only 2!).  My latest iteration I'm calling "piapp": a hodgepodge of FOSS educational apps bundled with an integrated WebRTC SoftPhone.
